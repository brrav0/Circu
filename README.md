== README

Following items to perform:
- test login with invalid information (see tutorial Mike Hartl)
- correct remaining failures
- enhance testing environment
- email address pre-filled when through links
- deployment on server (free) for final issuance of email
- test the redirection after the login as this depends on the user
- in integration test issues with assert_select where test fails even through the links appear in the layout (header) see test 'login with valid information' and 'logout triggers valid redirection and changes in layout'
